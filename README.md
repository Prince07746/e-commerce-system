### Getting Started
To get started with the E-commerce System, you need to clone the repository and set up your development environment.

#### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later
- Maven 3.6.3 or later
- Git

#### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prince07746/e-commerce-system.git
cd e-commerce-system
```

### Project Structure
The project follows a standard Maven directory structure:
```
e-commerce-system/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   └── resources/
│   └── test/
│       ├── java/
│       └── resources/
├── pom.xml
└── README.md
```

### Building the Project
To build the project, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start, and you can access it at `http://localhost:8080`.

### API Documentation
The E-commerce System's API is documented using Swagger. Swagger provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API endpoints.

### API Testing with Swagger
To access the Swagger UI for API testing, follow these steps:
1. Ensure the application is running.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

The Swagger UI will display all available API endpoints, allowing you to test them directly from the interface.

### Contributing
To contribute to the E-commerce System, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.

### Contact
For any inquiries or issues, please contact the repository owner via the GitHub repository's issue tracker.
